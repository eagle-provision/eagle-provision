Fullstack, Blockchain , AI developer.
Greetings! 

```rust
struct BlockchainDev {
    languages: Vec<&'static str>,
    tools: Vec<&'static str>,
    currently_learning: &'static str,
    fun_fact: &'static str,
}

impl BlockchainDev {
    fn new() -> BlockchainDev {
        BlockchainDev {
            languages: vec!["Solidity", "Rust", "Go"],
            tools: vec!["Ethereum", "Solana", "Polkadot"],
            currently_learning: "ZK-Rollups & Layer 2 Scaling",
            fun_fact: "I once explained blockchain to my grandma using Lego blocks. Sheâ€™s now a Bitcoin holder.",
        }
    }

    fn build_smart_contract(&self) {
        println!("Writing immutable code...");
        println!("Deploying to the blockchain...");
        println!("Praying for no gas fee spikes...");
    }
}

fn main() {
    let chain_dev = BlockchainDev::new();
    chain_dev.build_smart_contract();
}

```
I focused on full-stack development so far, but recently I've been focusing on AI and blockchain development.
I am learning new things and challenging myself every day !!
